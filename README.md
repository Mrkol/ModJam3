So, yeah, small description:

This mod replaces vanilla furnace with
a cool awesome looking UNGUI'd furnace.
Click with an item on the top part of the
furnace to put it there, click with a fuel
item on the bottom part of the furnace to
place the fuel inside.
Now you need to ignite the fuel.
Use a flint'n'steel or flint'n'stick
(same as flint'n'steel, but low tier and 
with a stick instead of iron ingot in
the crafting recipe) to ignite the 
furnace. Now you'll have to wait. You can
put more fuel into the furnace, or more items,
but not get anything from it. Know why?
CUZ IT'S IRON-MELTING TEMPERATURE HOT.
You'll have to wait until smoke completley
disappears, or use a water bucket on the
bottom part of the furnace to get it
extinguished.

And that's basically it.

If this concept will get popular -
I will continue removeing GUIs from
vanilla blocks.
List of GUIs to remove:
1. Furnace - DONE.
2. Crafting table
3. Brewing stand
4. Chest
5. Ender chest
6. Beacon
7. Player's inventory (this one is the ULTIMATE GOAL OF DEM ALL)



And beleive me, I am capable of doing all the things above.
I just need motivation >_<
